{"name":"Karta","tagline":"A tidy Python package for geospatial computation","body":"#Karta - tidy Python package for geospatial computation\r\n\r\n*Karta* is a Leatherman for geographic analyses. *Karta* provides an interface for solving\r\nproblems in Python that works nicely with existing packages. To this end, it provides a\r\nsimple and clean vector and raster data types, a selection of analysis functions, the\r\nability to read and write a useful subset of formats, and close interoperability with\r\n*numpy*.\r\n\r\nGoals of *Karta* include providing a simple, lightweight, and fast set of tools useful for\r\n\"everyday\" spatial analysis, as well as a flexible set of abstractions upon which to build\r\nmore advanced routines. *Karta* should be considered a work in progress.\r\n\r\n**Future goals:**\r\n- projection handling\r\n- native GeoTiff support\r\n- shapefile support through OGR rather than pyshp\r\n\r\n##CONTENTS AT A GLANCE\r\n\r\n- vector\r\n    - guppy:        Vector geometry classes (e.g. `Point`, `Multipoint`, `Line`, `Polygon`)\r\n    - gpx\\_parser:  Parser for GPX files exported from GPS devices\r\n    - geojson:      Classes and functions for reading and writing GeoJSON\r\n    - vtk:          XML-based VTK interface\r\n    - shp\\_funcs:   Shapefile-to-guppy conversions based on _pyshp_\r\n    - stats:        Geostatistical functions\r\n    - xyfile:       ASCII table functions\r\n\r\n- raster\r\n    - grid:         Basic Grid types, including `StructuredGrid` and `RegularGrid`\r\n    - aaigrid:      Grid subclass specifically for reading, writing, and manipulating ESRI ASCII grids\r\n    - flow:         Stream flow functions\r\n    - raster:       General purpose raster functions\r\n    - streamline:   Streamline calculation\r\n\r\n- tests : unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n##FORMATS\r\n\r\n*Karta* provides a basic working interface to several of common file formats. Currently\r\npartially-supported are:\r\n\r\n- vector\r\n    - ASCII tables (XYZ) (r,w)\r\n    - GeoJSON (r,w)\r\n    - VTK (w)\r\n    - ESRI Shapefiles via pyshp (r,w)\r\n- raster\r\n    - ESRI ASCII Grids (r,w)\r\n    - GeoTiff (WIP)\r\n\r\n## DEPENDENCIES\r\n\r\n- Python 2.x\r\n- numpy\r\n- scipy (optional)\r\n- Cython (optional)\r\n\r\n###CYTHON\r\n\r\nCython is an optional dependency used to speed up select functions. To compile the\r\nCython-enabled sub-modules, run:\r\n\r\n    setup.py build_ext --inplace\r\n\r\nIn general, enhanced-performance functions will then be called automatically when\r\navailable, otherwise *Karta* will fall back to numpy and pure-Python versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##LICENSE\r\n\r\nThis software is provided under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nThe vector module contains a snapshot of the pyshp shapefile module, available at\r\n(http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/).
