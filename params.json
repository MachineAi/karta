{"name":"Karta","tagline":"A tidy Python package for geospatial computation","body":"*Karta* is a Leatherman for geographic analyses. *Karta* provides an interface\r\nfor solving problems in Python that works nicely with existing packages. To this\r\nend, it provides simple and clean vector and raster data types, a selection of\r\nanalysis functions, the ability to read and write a small number of useful\r\nformats, and interoperability with *numpy*.\r\n\r\nGoals of *Karta* include providing a simple, lightweight, and fast set of tools\r\nuseful for \"everyday\" spatial analysis, as well as a flexible set of\r\nabstractions upon which to build more advanced routines. *Karta* should be\r\nconsidered a work in progress.\r\n\r\n**Current projects:**\r\n- test coverage\r\n- minimal system for coordinate system metadata\r\n\r\n**Future goals:**\r\n- native GeoTiff support?\r\n\r\n##CONTENTS AT A GLANCE\r\n\r\n- vector\r\n    - guppy:        Vector geometry classes (e.g. `Point`, `Multipoint`, `Line`, `Polygon`)\r\n    - gpx:          GPX class for parsing and constructing GPX eXchange files\r\n    - geojson:      Classes and functions for reading and writing GeoJSON\r\n    - vtk:          XML-based VTK interface\r\n    - shp\\_funcs:   Shapefile-to-guppy conversions based on _pyshp_\r\n    - stats:        Geostatistical functions\r\n    - xyfile:       ASCII table functions\r\n\r\n- raster\r\n    - grid:         Basic Grid types, including `StructuredGrid` and `RegularGrid`\r\n    - aaigrid:      Grid subclass specifically for reading, writing, and manipulating ESRI ASCII grids\r\n    - flow:         Stream flow functions\r\n    - raster:       General purpose raster functions\r\n    - streamline:   Streamline calculation\r\n\r\n- tests : unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n##FORMATS\r\n\r\n*Karta* provides a basic working interface to several of common file formats.\r\nCurrently partially-supported are:\r\n\r\n- vector\r\n    - ASCII tables (XYZ) (r,w)\r\n    - GeoJSON (r,w)\r\n    - GPS eXchange (GPX) (r,w)\r\n    - VTK (w)\r\n    - ESRI Shapefiles via pyshp (r,w)\r\n- raster\r\n    - ESRI ASCII Grid (r,w)\r\n    - USGS DEM (WIP)\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install is to use `pip`.\r\n\r\n    cd karta/\r\n    pip install .\r\n\r\n## DEPENDENCIES\r\n\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n- Python 2.x\r\n- numpy\r\n\r\n### Optional\r\n\r\n- pyproj (required for geodetic calculations)\r\n- scipy\r\n- Cython\r\n\r\nCython is an optional dependency used to speed up select functions. In general,\r\nenhanced-performance functions will then be called automatically when available,\r\notherwise *Karta* will fall back to numpy and pure-Python versions.\r\n\r\n## TESTING\r\n\r\nTo run all unit tests, execute\r\n\r\n    python -m karta.tests.test_runner\r\n\r\n##LICENSE\r\n\r\nThis software is provided under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nThe vector module contains a snapshot of the pyshp shapefile module, available\r\nat (http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/).
