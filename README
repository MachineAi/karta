README

geo_tools contains a collection of loosely-related Python modules for
performing lightweight geospatial data analysis. geo_tools replicates
the functionality of GDAL, OGR, and GSTAT in some cases, but does so in
a minimal package with few dependencies.

geo_tools should be considered experimental, and no assurances are
provided about the correctness of the code or results derived using it.

The vector module contains a snapshot of the pyshp shapefile library,
available at http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/. This library is availble
under the MIT license.
